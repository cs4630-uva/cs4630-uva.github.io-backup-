<p><strong>Course Objectives</strong></p>

<p>This course aims to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted realm of computer security. Participants will delve into the ethical considerations tied to computer security breaches, grasp the intricacies of software vulnerabilities, and discern how adversaries exploit them. The curriculum offers insights into a plethora of malware types, such as viruses, worms, ransomware, and trojans, as well as other attacks encompassing social engineering, phishing, and denial of service. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in the methods to prevent, detect, and repair malware threats and will have hands-on experience with program binary examination tools to identify malicious code.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Academic Integrity</summary>

  Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud (http://honor.virginia.edu/ academic-fraud).

  * Students are encouraged to discuss programs in general and to help one another find bugs in existing programs. However, using another's code or writing code for someone else is cheating and a violation of the University's Honor System. This includes consulting solutions to assignments from previous years or tests from previous years. Keep code listings to provide evidence of your creative development.

  * Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. This means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam, assignment, or project to a student who has not taken it yet. You are also not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student's exam papers while working on an exam.

  * Sending, receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents of electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions).
  Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee, if appropriate.

  If you have questions on what is allowable, please ask!

<details>
  <summary>Special Accommodations</summary>

  The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with us.

  If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, to request official accommodations, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website at http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu.

  If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please make sure to send us your accommodation letter and meet with us so we can develop an implementation plan together
</details>

<!-- part 10 -->
<details>
  <summary>Religious Accommodations</summary>

  Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to the instructors by email as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about your request, you can contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework you miss as the result of a religious observance.
</details>

<!-- part 11 -->
<details>
  <summary>Discrimination and Violence</summary>
  The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that the University and I hold as critically important:

  * Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
  * Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.
  * Everyone is expected to treat each other with respect and courtesy at all times.

  If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence. As your professor, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am designated responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you wish to report something that you have seen, use the Just Report It portal (http://justreportit.virginia.edu/). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.
