						<td><b>🎯 Course Objectives</b></td>
						<td>
							This course aims to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted realm of computer security. Participants will delve into the ethical considerations tied to computer security breaches, grasp the intricacies of software vulnerabilities, and discern how adversaries exploit them. The curriculum offers insights into a plethora of malware types, such as viruses, worms, ransomware, and trojans, as well as other attacks encompassing social engineering, phishing, and denial of service. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in the methods to prevent, detect, and repair malware threats and will have hands-on experience with program binary examination tools to identify malicious code.

							<p> Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the

							<ul>
								<li> Students are encouraged to discuss programs in general and to help
									one another find bugs in existing programs. However, using another's
									code or writing code for someone else is cheating and a violation of
									the University's Honor System. This includes consulting solutions to
									assignments from previous years or tests from previous years. Keep
									code listings to provide evidence of your creative development.
								<li> Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be
									considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help.
									This means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam,
									assignment, or project to a student who has not taken it yet. You are
									also not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student's
									exam papers while
									working on an exam.
								<li> Sending, receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents
									of electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed
									collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions).
								<li> Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur
									will receive a zero
									grade for that entire assignment or
									exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee, if
									appropriate.

								The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable
								learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know
								two values that the University and I hold as critically important:
							<ul>
								<li> Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
								<li> Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on
									Grounds.
								<li> Everyone is expected to treat each other with respect and courtesy at
									all times.
							</ul>
							If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more
							information can be found
							on the UVA Sexual Violence website
							that describes reporting options and resources available www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence. As
							your professor, know that I care about you
							and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as
							I can. As a faculty member, I am designated responsible employee, which
							means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what
							you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator.
							The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the
							resources and support
							that they need, while also reviewing the
							information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to
							ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you
							wish to report something that you have seen, use the Just Report It portal
							(http://justreportit.virginia.edu/). The worst possible situation would be for you or your
							friend to remain
							silent when there are so
							many here willing and able to help.
