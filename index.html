			</ul>

			</p> -->

			<h3> Academic Integrity </h3>
			<p> Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic
				fraud (http://honor.virginia.edu/
				academic-fraud).
			<ul>
				<li> Students are encouraged to discuss programs in general and to help
					one another find bugs in existing programs. However, using another's
					code or writing code for someone else is cheating and a violation of
					the University's Honor System. This includes consulting solutions to
					assignments from previous years or tests from previous years. Keep
					code listings to provide evidence of your creative development.
				<li> Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be
					considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help.
					This means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam,
					assignment, or project to a student who has not taken it yet. You are
					also not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student's exam papers while
					working on an exam.
				<li> Sending, receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents
					of electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed
					collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions).
				<li> Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero
					grade for that entire assignment or
					exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee, if appropriate.
			</ul>
			If you have questions on what is allowable, please ask!</p>

			<h3> Special Accommodations</h3>
			<p>
				The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If
				you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please
				feel welcome to discuss your concerns with us.
				<br>
				If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please
				contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or
				sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, to
				request official accommodations, or to learn more about their services, you
				may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website at
				http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu.
				<br>
				If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC,
				please make sure to send us your accommodation letter and meet with us
				so we can develop an implementation plan together
			</p>

			<h3> Religious Accommodations</h3>
			<p>
				Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their
				request to the instructors by email as far in
				advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about your request,
				you can contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil
				Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the
				responsibility for completion of any part of
				the coursework you miss as the result of a religious observance.
			</p>

			<h3> Disrimination and Violence</h3>
			<p>
				The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable
				learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know
				two values that the University and I hold as critically important:
			<ul>
				<li> Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
				<li> Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.
				<li> Everyone is expected to treat each other with respect and courtesy at
					all times.
			</ul>
			If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found
			on the UVA Sexual Violence website
			that describes reporting options and resources available www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence. As your professor, know that I care about you
			and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as
			I can. As a faculty member, I am designated responsible employee, which
			means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what
			you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator.
			The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support
			that they need, while also reviewing the
			information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to
			ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you
			wish to report something that you have seen, use the Just Report It portal
			(http://justreportit.virginia.edu/). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain
			silent when there are so
			many here willing and able to help.
			</p>
